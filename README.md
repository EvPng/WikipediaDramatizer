# WikipediaDramatizer
 
Wikipedia Dramatizer is a web tool to examine the edit history of Wikipedia to expose contested areas of knowledge. In addition to providing openings to discovering interesting stories, the Dramatizer is intended to humanize the landscape of Wikipedia editing. It can serve as a reminder of the distinct and overlapping conversations and communities that form around the creation of articles, as well as the individuals who contribute to the editing process on their own.
